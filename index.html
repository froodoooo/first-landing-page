                    Hailing from the mean streets of Malvern, Walyer is a menace to society. He beats women, commits acts of aviation terrorism, and is constantly hanging himself. Join the Anti-Walter League to stop this domestic terrorist now.

                <figcaption>Walyer was so weird around me. Kept talking about my hair and asking me about my car. I think he knew I lowkey had a thing for him. But when push comes to shove, he ran out the room when I needed his help to defend my honor.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>He paid for my bus fare like such a gentleman. But it all went downhill after that. He kept ignoring me and beating other women at the store, and I just wanted him. Why lead someone on the way he did if he's just going to go for stupid whores instead? Walyer please call me I love you.</figcaption>
